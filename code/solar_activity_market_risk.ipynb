    "# **Solar Activity and Market Risk 🌞📉**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Empirical exploration of the relationship between solar activity and equity market risk.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the **hypothesis** that measures of solar activity (Sunspot Numbers) may be statistically associated with changes in the **risk environment** of the S&P 500 equity market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the underlying assumption is that variations in solar activity could coincide with different market risk regimes, either contemporaneously or with a short temporal lag. The task is therefore **not to assert a causal relationship**, but to empirically test whether such an association can be detected using standard statistical tools, under careful data alignment and without the use of future information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial risk is a central concept in asset pricing and portfolio management, yet it does **not admit a unique quantitative definition**. Depending on the context, risk may refer to drawdowns, tail losses, uncertainty, or volatility. In empirical finance, however, **volatility remains the most widely used and operational proxy for market risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, market risk is proxied by:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Monthly realized volatility**, defined as the within-month standard deviation of daily log-returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice is motivated by several considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- volatility captures dispersion and uncertainty, rather than average performance;\n",
    "- it reflects the internal state of the market, not directional bets;\n",
    "- it can be consistently aggregated to monthly frequency;\n",
    "- it is a standard benchmark in both academic and applied finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar activity, by contrast, is a **slow-moving, fully exogenous physical process**, unaffected by market dynamics. Its low frequency naturally motivates a **monthly resolution**, which in turn justifies aggregating market data to the same temporal scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why log-returns are used instead of simple returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily market returns are computed using **logarithmic returns** rather than simple returns, which is standard practice in quantitative finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice is justified by several mathematical and statistical advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Additivity over time**: log-returns are additive across periods, which allows cumulative effects within a month to be treated coherently when estimating volatility.\n",
    "- **Improved statistical behavior**: log-returns tend to be closer to stationarity and more symmetrically distributed than simple returns, which is desirable for correlation and regression analysis.\n",
    "- **Scale invariance**: log-returns are independent of the absolute price level, avoiding distortions caused by long-term price growth.\n",
    "- **Local equivalence**: for small daily price changes, log-returns are numerically very close to simple returns, while preserving the analytical advantages above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that market risk in this project is measured through the **volatility of daily returns aggregated to the monthly level**, log-returns provide a cleaner mathematical framework without altering the economic interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodological approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis proceeds by constructing a clean monthly dataset combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "- solar activity measures,\n",
    "- and realized market risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two temporal alignments are explicitly distinguished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrospective (contemporaneous) analysis**, where solar activity and market risk are aligned within the same month.  \n",
    "   This setting is explanatory and not predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictive (anti-lookahead) analysis**, where solar activity observed in month *M* is used to explain market risk in month *M+1*.  \n",
    "   This configuration avoids any use of future information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis includes correlation measures and a simple linear baseline regression, with inference based on heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC / Newey–West) standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "No parameter optimization or trading strategy is pursued.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This project does **not** aim to forecast returns or construct an investment strategy.  \n",
    "Its objective is more modest and precise:\n",
    "\n",
    "> to test whether solar activity is weakly associated with the market risk regime, either contemporaneously or with a short temporal lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any detected relationship should therefore be interpreted as **structural and contextual**, not as a direct or exploitable predictive signal.\n",

    "These results indicate that, within the same month, higher levels of solar activity tend to be associated with **lower realized market risk**. The fact that both Pearson and Spearman correlations are negative and statistically significant suggests that the relationship is not driven by a small number of outliers and is robust to departures from strict linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contemporaneous association should be interpreted as **explanatory**, not predictive: it indicates that solar activity and the market risk environment tend to co-move weakly within the same time window.\n",

    "When solar activity observed in month *M* is aligned with market risk in month *M+1*, the results remain remarkably similar in both sign and magnitude. The persistence of a negative correlation under this strict anti-lookahead setup indicates that the observed relationship is **not an artifact of contemporaneous alignment**.\n",

    "- The **consistency of the sign** across Pearson and Spearman measures, and across both temporal alignments, supports the existence of a weak structural association.\n",
    "- These results do **not** suggest a direct causal mechanism or a trading signal, but rather point to solar activity as a potential **contextual or regime-related factor**.\n",
    "\n",

This motivates further analysis using regression-based approaches, while maintaining a cautious interpretation of economic significance.\n"

    "## Interpretation of Regression Results (Baseline)\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline regression provides a useful complement to the correlation analysis, while illustrating the importance of correct inference in time-series settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under **classical OLS standard errors**, the estimated coefficient on solar activity is negative and statistically significant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\beta} = -2.26 \\times 10^{-5}$\n",
    "- $t$-statistic ≈ −2.58  \n",
    "- $p$-value ≈ 0.01  \n",
    "- $R^2 \\approx 0.026$\n",
    "\n",
    "At face value, this would suggest a negative linear association between solar activity and monthly market risk. However, this inference relies on strong assumptions about the regression residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once **HAC / Newey–West standard errors** (12 monthly lags) are applied, the point estimate remains unchanged, but statistical significance is reduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $t$-statistic ≈ −1.29  \n",
    "- $p$-value ≈ 0.20  \n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the apparent significance under classical OLS is sensitive to serial correlation and heteroskedasticity, which are well-known features of volatility-related time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the regression results should be viewed as **exploratory and diagnostic**. They confirm the direction and order of magnitude suggested by the correlation analysis, but do not yet provide strong evidence of a robust linear effect. A more complete interpretation requires examining the **stability of the relationship over time**, which is addressed in the next section.\n"

    "\n",
    "The results show substantial variation across subperiods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P1 (2005–2011)**: the estimated coefficient is negative, but not statistically significant.\n",
    "- **P2 (2012–2018)**: the coefficient is effectively zero, indicating no detectable association during this period.\n",
    "- **P3 (2019–2025)**: the coefficient returns to a negative sign, but remains statistically insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all three subperiods:\n",

    "- the explanatory power remains very low ($R^2$ close to zero);\n",
    "- the sign of the coefficient is not fully stable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that the relationship between solar activity and market risk, while present as a weak association in the full sample, **is not uniform across time**. This lack of stability motivates a cautious interpretation and reinforces the need to consider the results as **contextual rather than structural**, an issue discussed more fully in the final section.\n"

    "## Final Conclusions and Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This project set out to evaluate the **hypothesis** that solar activity may contain useful information about the **risk environment** of the S&P 500 equity market, with the ultimate goal of assessing whether such information could reasonably support **investment-related decisions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of empirical findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis yields a coherent and internally consistent set of results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation analysis** reveals a weak but statistically detectable **negative association** between solar activity and market risk, both contemporaneously and with a one-month lag. Higher solar activity tends to coincide with, or slightly precede, periods of lower realized volatility.\n",
    "- **Baseline regression analysis** confirms the direction and order of magnitude of this association, but shows that statistical significance is **not robust** once heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation are properly accounted for using HAC / Newey–West inference.\n",
    "- **Stability analysis across subperiods** indicates that the relationship is **not uniform over time**. The estimated effect varies in magnitude and even becomes indistinguishable from zero in some periods, with no subperiod exhibiting statistically significant results under robust inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these findings point to a relationship that is **weak, unstable, and dominated by the internal dynamics of market risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation in the context of the challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "From a scientific perspective, the results suggest that solar activity may act as a **slow-moving contextual variable**, weakly associated with the market’s risk regime. However, this association:\n",
    "\n",
    "- explains only a very small fraction of the variation in market risk,\n",
    "- lacks temporal stability,\n",
    "- and does not survive stringent statistical inference as a strong linear effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an **investment and capital allocation standpoint**, these characteristics are decisive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation regarding investment use\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the evidence presented in this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solar activity data should not be used as a standalone signal** for investment decisions or risk timing.\n",
    "- The detected associations are **too weak and unstable** to support systematic trading or allocation strategies.\n",
    "- Any attempt to directly exploit this relationship would likely be overwhelmed by noise, regime changes, and more dominant market forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "At most, solar activity could be considered as a **secondary, contextual input** within a broader analytical framework, for example as a qualitative indicator of background conditions rather than as an actionable quantitative signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the analysis provides interesting empirical evidence of a weak association between solar activity and market risk, it does **not** support the use of solar data as a reliable or economically meaningful driver for investment decisions. The results are best interpreted as an illustration of how exogenous physical variables may correlate with financial market regimes, rather than as a foundation for capital deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conclusion aligns with the broader empirical finance literature: **detectable statistical relationships do not automatically translate into usable investment signals**, especially in complex, adaptive systems such as financial markets.\n"

    "## Results and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical results do not provide evidence that solar activity, as measured by the monthly Sunspot Number, contains incremental predictive information about daily S&P 500 returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all specifications, the estimated coefficient on the lagged sunspot variable is statistically indistinguishable from zero. This conclusion holds both under classical OLS standard errors and under heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust (Newey–West) standard errors. The magnitude of the estimated effect is economically negligible, and the explanatory power of the model, as measured by the R-squared, is effectively zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings are consistent with the well-known difficulty of predicting daily equity returns and suggest that, at this frequency, any potential relationship between solar activity and market returns is either extremely weak or dominated by noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the absence of statistical significance is robust to conservative timing assumptions designed to eliminate look-ahead bias. The result therefore reflects a genuine lack of predictive content rather than a modeling or data-alignment artifact.\n"

    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Several limitations of the present analysis should be acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the empirical design focuses on **daily returns**, which are known to be highly noisy and difficult to predict. It is possible that any behavioral effects associated with solar activity, if they exist, may operate at lower frequencies and be more difficult to detect at the daily level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the analysis relies on a **single proxy for solar activity**. While the Sunspot Number is a standard and widely used indicator, it may not fully capture the aspects of solar or geomagnetic activity hypothesized to influence human mood or risk preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the results are conditional on a deliberately simple and transparent modeling framework. While this is appropriate for a baseline empirical test, more complex nonlinear or regime-dependent effects are not explored here.\n"

    "## Investment conclusion\n",

    "Based strictly on the empirical evidence presented in this analysis, we would **not allocate capital** to a trading strategy based on solar activity signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated relationship between sunspot activity and daily S&P 500 returns is neither statistically significant nor economically meaningful. Moreover, the lack of robustness across standard inference frameworks and the near-zero explanatory power indicate that the signal does not provide a reliable source of predictability.\n",
